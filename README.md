Getting-and-cleaning-data-project
=================================
Jin Zhang

This repo is for the submission of the project for Getting and Cleaning Data course.

It contains three files.

One R scrip named run_analysis.R that does the following.
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

One code book named CodeBook.md that describes the variables, the data, and any other work have been done during the cleaning up.

One README.md that explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
